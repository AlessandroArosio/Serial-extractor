# Serial-extractor
DPS/CB serial number extractor

This small piece of code helped me to extract from a serverReport.txt all the serial numbers I needed for my work.
It allowed me to save a lot of time, copying and pasting all the serials one by one into a .doc document (either packing note or commercial invoices).
